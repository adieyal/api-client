#### Fetch all Sources in a Collection

```python
import mediacloud.api
INDIA_NATIONAL_COLLECTION = 34412118
SOURCES_PER_PAGE = 100  # the number of sources retrieved per page
mc_directory = mediacloud.api.DirectoryApi(MC_API_KEY)
sources = []
offset = 0   # offset for paging through
while True:
    # grab a page of sources in the collection
    response = mc_directory.source_list(collection_id=INDIA_NATIONAL_COLLECTION, limit=SOURCES_PER_PAGE, offset=offset)
    # add it to our running list of all the sources in the collection
    sources += response['results']
    # if there is no next page then we're done so bail out
    if response['next'] is None:
        break
    # otherwise setup to fetch the next page of sources
    offset += len(response['results'])
print("India National Collection has {} sources".format(len(sources)))
```
